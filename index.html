        <div class="educ-main">
            <p class="educ-txt">"During my <span class="educ-lights">elementary years</span>, I developed a strong foundation in learning and curiosity.
                 I enjoyed exploring different subjects, from math and science 
                 to reading and writing. I actively participated in school activities,
                  which helped me build confidence and teamwork skills. Those early
                   experiences shaped my passion for problem-solving and creativity, which
                    continue to inspire me today. My time in elementary school was filled
                     with valuable lessons, friendships, and memories that have contributed
                      to my personal and academic growth."</p>
            <p class="educ-txt">"<span class="educ-lights">High school</span> was a transformative period in my life, where
                 I faced new challenges and discovered my true interests. I became more
                  independent in my studies, learning to manage my time and responsibilities effectively.
                   Through various academic and extracurricular activities, I developed skills in
                    critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. High school also introduced me to
                     new friendships and experiences that shaped my personality and aspirations.
                      It was during this time that I started exploring my passion for technology
                       and programming, setting the foundation for my future goals."</p>
            <p class="educ-txt">"<span class="educ-lights">Grades 11 and 12</span> were crucial years that prepared me
                 for my future. As I tackled more advanced subjects, I learned the
                  importance of discipline, perseverance, and adaptability.
                   Balancing academics with extracurricular activities and personal growth
                    became a challenge, but it helped me develop resilience and time
                     management skills. These years also solidified my interest in technology
                      and programming, guiding me toward my career aspirations. Through hard work
                       and determination, I gained valuable experiences and knowledge that shaped my confidence
                        in pursuing higher education and future opportunities."</p>
            <p class="educ-txt">"<span class="educ-lights">College</span> has been a challenging yet rewarding journey,
                 especially as I dive deeper into the world of programming. Now in
                  my second year, I have explored various programming languages, including HTML,
                   CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. These experiences have strengthened my
                    problem-solving skills and deepened my passion for web development. As I work 
                    toward becoming a full-stack web developer, I am continuously learning new technologies 
                    and improving my coding abilities. College has not only expanded my technical knowledge
                     but also taught me perseverance and adaptability, shaping me into a more capable
                      and driven individual."</p>
